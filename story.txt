Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the banks of the rivers. 
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As days passed by the monkey and the crocodile became good friends.
One day monkey sent some fruits for the crocodiles wife. She had the fruits and liked them, but was jealous, as she didnt like her husband
spending time with the monkey. She told her husband, "If the fruits are so juicy, i wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me the heart of the mokey."
The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend, but had no choice.
